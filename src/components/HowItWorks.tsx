          Tree++ aims to achieve net zero by offering carbon offsetting through
          tree plantation. Individuals can calculate their carbon footprint and
          purchase carbon offsets on the digital platform. Landowners with
          unused plantation-ready lands can enlist them on the same platform.
          Tree++ provides a unique opportunity for youth to actively participate
          in the green movement, receiving incentives for their efforts.
          Corporations of any size can offset their carbon emissions effectively
          through Tree++. This novel platform connects all stakeholders involved
          in carbon offsetting through tree plantation in a win-win-win manner.
